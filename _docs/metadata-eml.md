## Associated Parties

All `US MBON` affiliated datasets should include, at least, one **Associated Party** which is affiliated with `US MBON`. This allows OBIS to create an institute page which reflects `US MBON`'s contributions (similar to SCB MBON <https://obis.org/institute/19534>). This is possible because `US MBON` has an OceanExpert institution which will link the various datasets together in an institute page.


US MBON Ocean Expert Institution: <https://oceanexpert.org/institution/23070> <br/>
US MBON OBIS Institution:         <https://obis.org/institute/23070>

_To create an **OceanExpert** institution, follow the 
[Appendix: How-to Create an OceanExpert Institution](#appendix-how-to-create-an-oceanexpert-institution)._

## Appendix: How to create an OceanExpert institution

Before creating a new institution it's always good to first do a search to make sure your institution doesn't already 
exist in **OceanExpert**. You can search for institutions at <https://oceanexpert.org/advancedSearch>. Be sure to check 
various spellings and acronyms too!

To create an **OceanExpert** institution:
1. Create an **OceanExpert** account: <https://oceanexpert.org/register>
2. Once your account is created, log in and edit your profile:<br> 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8480023/207622140-89c3bbb5-1abd-4058-809b-8434635bfa54.png)
3. In the **Affiliation and Address** section of the profile there is a dropdown menu for `Organisation/Institution/Company`, select the first option `Cannot find my Institute - Create New`: <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8480023/207622420-52592ce2-bda7-4ba4-a40a-47417ca6bca7.png)
4. A new window will pop up and ask you to populate a new institution record:<br> 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8480023/207622801-e395e6af-dd61-4247-a865-b5a86dcaf787.png)
   1. The only required fields are: `Name`, `Type` (choose from Academic, Government, International / Intergovernmental, NGO, Private Commercial, Private non-profit, and Research), `Address`, `Zip Code`, and `City`.
5. Click **Add Institution**.
6. That should add the institution to the drop down list for `Organisation/Institution/Company` so that you can associate it with your profile.

To edit **OceanExpert** institution pages, send an email to <mailto:info@oceanexpert.org> with the requested changes.
